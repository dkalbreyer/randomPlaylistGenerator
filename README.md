If any step in the USER-MANUAL does not work, please take a screenshot of the terminal and send it to kallekalbreyer@gmail.com


USER-MANUAL:
1. Install python3 to your system, take the recommended version for your operating system on https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Open a terminal/console on your computer
3. Enter "python3 --version" in the terminal to check if the installation was succesfull -> it was, if there is something like "Python 3.9.5"
3. Navigate to the path, where the project should be placed (you can skip this step if the project should be placed in your home folder)
4. Enter "git clone https://github.com/dkalbreyer/randomPlaylistGenerator.git" in the terminal and press return on your keyboard (clones the whole github-project "randomPlaylistGenerator" to your filesystem)
4. Navigate to the folder <randomPlaylistGenerator>
6. Enter "make install" in the terminal
7. Copy all musicFiles or -folders in the folder <randomPlaylistGenerator>, that should be in the playlist
